As a software engineer at Nodestead Inc., I had the opportunity to make valuable contributions to the development of a hosting service startup. One of my main areas of focus was the creation of reusable components and functionality using React, JavaScript, and Styled Components. This not only streamlined the development process but also resulted in a 50% reduction in development cycle time.

Building upon this success, I was able to effectively utilize the gained efficiency in the design and development of a footer for the homepage.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/homepage.gif" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

In addition to my technical contributions, I have also been involved in requirements walkthroughs with the CTO. These meetings have provided valuable insights into user needs and have allowed us to better understand how to scale the customer journey. I have also taken the lead on developing customized marketing email templates using HTML and CSS, which have resulted in a 25% improvement in clickthrough rate.

One of the projects that I am particularly proud of is the creation of an internal tool to assist with the onboarding process for new users onto the Urbit network. This tool has significantly reduced customer onboarding time by 70%. In addition to improving efficiency, it has also helped to improve the overall user experience.

It also gave me the opportunity to further my passion for software engineering and to work on projects that have made a tangible impact on the company and its users.
