I had the opportunity to work with a talented team to create a website that helps formerly incarcerated individuals pursue a technical career.

I led the design and development of various components, including an application submission feature and a new feature that significantly reduced mentee attrition.

In addition, I designed a relational database schema to efficiently store data and updated legacy code to improve user engagement by 30%.

It was a rewarding experience to contribute to a project that has a positive impact on individuals looking to embark on a new career path.
