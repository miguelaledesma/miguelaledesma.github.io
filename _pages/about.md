My name is Miguel Ledesma and I am a software engineer with experience in developing both front-end and back-end applications. I have a passion for creating user-friendly and efficient solutions to real-world problems, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle.

In my past projects, I have utilized a variety of technologies including React, Node.js, and MongoDB to create functional and visually appealing websites and applications.

When I'm not coding, you can find me at the gym or trying to make the perfect shot of espresso. Thank you for visiting my website, I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it.
